      GitHub.com was a bootstrapped start-up business, which in its first years
      provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and
      start taking on employees.[19] In July 2012, four years after the company
      was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in venture
      capital.[4] In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million of venture
      capital in a series B round. Investors were Sequoia Capital, Andreessen
      Horowitz, Thrive Capital and other venture capital funds.[20] As of 2018,
      GitHub was estimated to be generating $200–300 million in Annual Recurring
      Revenue.[1] The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J.
      Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and
      started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed since
      2007 and is located in San Francisco.[21] The shading of the map
      illustrates the number of users as a proportion of each country's Internet
      population. The circular charts surrounding the two hemispheres depict the
      total number of GitHub users (left) and commits (right) per country. On
      February 24, 2009, GitHub announced that within the first year of being
      online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of
      which were formed in the previous month. At that time, about 6,200
      repositories had been forked at least once and 4,600 had been merged. That
      same year, the site was used by over 100,000 users, according to GitHub,
      and had grown to host 90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having
      been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.[22] In
      2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories.[23] A year later, this
      number doubled.[24] ReadWriteWeb reported that GitHub had surpassed
      SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits for the period of
      January to May 2011.[25] On January 16, 2013, GitHub passed the 3 million
      users mark and was then hosting more than 5 million repositories.[26] By
      the end of the year, the number of repositories was twice as great,
      reaching 10 million repositories.[27] In 2012, GitHub raised $100 million
      in funding from Andreessen Horowitz with $750 million valuation.[28] On
      July 29, 2015, GitHub stated it had raised $250 million in funding in a
      round led by Sequoia Capital. Other investors of that round included
      Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and IVP (Institutional Venture
      Partners).[29] The round valued the company at approximately $2
      billion.[30] In 2015, GitHub opened an office in Japan, its first outside
      of the U.S.[31] In 2016, GitHub was ranked No. 14 on the Forbes Cloud 100
      list.[32] It has not been featured on the 2018, 2019 and 2020 lists.[33]
      On February 28, 2018, GitHub fell victim to the third largest distributed
      denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history, with incoming traffic reaching
      a peak of about 1.35 terabits per second.[34] On June 19, 2018, GitHub
      expanded its GitHub Education by offering free education bundles to all
      schools.[35][36]-----------------From 2012, Microsoft became a significant
      user of GitHub, using it to host open-source projects and development
      tools such as .NET Core, Chakra Core, MSBuild, PowerShell, PowerToys,
      Visual Studio Code, Windows Calculator, Windows Terminal and the bulk of
      its product documentation (now to be found on Microsoft Docs).[38][39] On
      June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US$7.5
      billion. The deal closed on October 26, 2018.[40] GitHub continued to
      operate independently as a community, platform and business.[41] Under
      Microsoft, the service was led by Xamarin's Nat Friedman, reporting to
      Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft Cloud and AI.
      GitHub's CEO, Chris Wanstrath, was retained as a "technical fellow," also
      reporting to Guthrie. There have been concerns from developers Kyle
      Simpson, JavaScript trainer and author, and Rafael Laguna, CEO at
      Open-Xchange over Microsoft's purchase, citing uneasiness over Microsoft's
      handling of previous acquisitions, such as Nokia's mobile business or
      Skype.[42][43] This acquisition was in line with Microsoft's business
      strategy under CEO Satya Nadella, which has seen a larger focus on the
      cloud computing services, alongside development of and contributions to
      open-source software.[5][39][44] Harvard Business Review argued that
      Microsoft was intending to acquire GitHub to get access to its user base,
      so it can be used as a loss leader to encourage use of its other
      development products and services.[45] Concerns over the sale bolstered
      interest in competitors: Bitbucket (owned by Atlassian), GitLab (a
      commercial open source product that also runs a hosted service version)
      and SourceForge (owned by BIZX, LLC) reported that they had seen spikes in
      new users intending to migrate projects from GitHub to their respective
      services.[46][47][48][49] In September 2019, GitHub acquired Semmle, a
      code analysis tool.[50] In February 2020, GitHub launched in India under
      the name GitHub India Private Limited.[51] In March 2020, GitHub announced
      that they were acquiring npm, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an
      undisclosed sum of money.[52] The deal was closed on 15 April 2020.[53] In
      early July 2020, the GitHub Archive Program was established, to archive
      its open source code in perpetuity.[54]GitHub has a $200,000 contract with
      U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the use of their
      on-site product GitHub Enterprise Server. This contract was renewed in
      2019, despite internal opposition from many GitHub employees. In an email
      sent to employees, later posted to the GitHub blog on October 9, 2019, CEO
      Nat Friedman stated "The revenue from the purchase is less than $200,000
      and not financially material for our company." He announced that GitHub
      had pledged to donate $500,000 to "nonprofit groups supporting immigrant
      communities targeted by the current administration."[121] In response at
      least 150 GitHub employees signed an open letter re-stating their
      opposition to the contract, and denouncing alleged human rights abuses by
      ICE. As of November 13, 2019, five workers had resigned over the
      contract.[122][123][124] The ICE contract dispute came into focus again in
      June 2020 due to the company's decision to abandon "master/slave" branch
      terminology, spurred by the George Floyd protests and Black Lives Matter
      movement.[125] Detractors of GitHub describe the branch renaming to be a
      form of performative activism and have urged GitHub to cancel their ICE
      contract instead.[126] An open letter from members of the open source
      community was shared on GitHub in December 2019, demanding that the
      company drop their contract with ICE and provide more transparency into
      how they conduct business and partnerships. The letter has been signed by
      more than 700 people.[127]GitHub.com was a bootstrapped start-up business,
      which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by
